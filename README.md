## Overview

The RPG is a simulation-driven concept for a solid-state energy generator based on recursive pulse timing and magnetic vortex feedback. It uses **no moving parts** and is modeled using the **Wolfram Language**.

This repository is part of an open call for experimental replication and theoretical scrutiny.

## Key Concepts

- Recursive energy cycling using spiral coil geometry
- Induction from pulsed disruption of static magnetic fields
- Ferrofluid-based magnetic turbulence shaping
- Modeled in time-domain with losses and feedback amplification
- Operates entirely within classical electrodynamics

---

## Status

- **Simulation-only** (no hardware prototype yet)
- **Open to replication**
- **No extraordinary claims** â€” energy is harvested, not created

## RPG-Inspired Innovations

The `innovations/` directory contains five additional technologies that extend RPG principles into different physical domains:

- **AREH**: Acoustic Resonance Energy Harvester - Sound wave energy through crystalline resonance
- **TGPG**: Thermal Gradient Pulse Generator - Temperature differential energy through thermal cycling  
- **PVC**: Photonic Vortex Concentrator - Light energy through optical vortex manipulation
- **PFO**: Plasma Field Oscillator - Ionic/plasma energy through controlled plasma dynamics
- **QRA**: Quantum Resonance Amplifier - Quantum energy through room-temperature quantum effects

These innovations can operate independently or in hybrid configurations for multi-modal environmental energy harvesting.
