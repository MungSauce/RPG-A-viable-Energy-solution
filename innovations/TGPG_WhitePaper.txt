Abstract

The Thermal Gradient Pulse Generator (TGPG) applies the recursive feedback principles of the RPG to thermal energy harvesting, creating a solid-state system that amplifies small temperature differentials through pulsed thermal cycling and geometric heat concentration.

Unlike conventional thermoelectric generators that passively convert temperature differences, the TGPG actively manipulates thermal gradients through precisely timed thermal pulses, geometric heat focusing, and recursive thermal amplification. The system creates thermal vortex patterns analogous to the magnetic vortices in the original RPG.

The TGPG harvests energy from ambient temperature variations, waste heat, solar thermal input, geothermal gradients, and even body heat. It employs solid-state thermal manipulation without moving parts, using thermoelectric materials, thermal concentrators, and phase-change materials to create self-amplifying thermal cycles.

The system is designed for distributed thermal energy harvesting in applications ranging from building thermal management to industrial waste heat recovery and wearable energy generation. Multiple thermal zones can operate simultaneously through modular thermal chamber arrays.

All performance projections are based on thermodynamic modeling and heat transfer simulation frameworks. This whitepaper serves as both a technical specification and an open call for thermal engineering validation and optimization.

Design Origin and Thermal Innovation Basis

The TGPG extends RPG's recursive energy amplification into the thermal domain. Where the RPG creates electromagnetic vortices through pulsed field disruption, the TGPG creates thermal vortices through pulsed heat cycling and geometric thermal concentration.

The innovation builds on established thermodynamics: the Seebeck effect, thermal conductivity gradients, and phase-change energy storage. However, it introduces recursive thermal cycling that allows harvested thermal energy to enhance subsequent heat capture and concentration, creating self-reinforcing thermal gradients.

The TGPG operates within classical thermodynamics and heat transfer principles, requiring no exotic materials beyond advanced thermoelectric compounds and thermal management systems already in commercial development.

Core Principle

The TGPG does not violate the laws of thermodynamics. It concentrates existing environmental thermal energy through active thermal cycling, geometric heat focusing, and recursive thermal amplification. Thermal energy naturally present in temperature differentials is captured, concentrated through thermal cycling, and converted to electrical energy at higher efficiency than conventional passive systems.

The system achieves enhanced performance by disrupting thermal equilibrium through precisely timed thermal pulses, similar to how the RPG disrupts magnetic equilibrium through electromagnetic pulses.

Thermodynamic Physics Principles

Seebeck Effect Enhancement

V = S × ΔT × η_cycle

Where V is voltage output, S is Seebeck coefficient, ΔT is temperature differential, and η_cycle is the cycling efficiency enhancement factor.

Thermal Cycling Amplification

Q_effective = Q_input × (1 + α_recursive)

Where Q_effective is the effective thermal energy available for conversion, Q_input is the ambient thermal input, and α_recursive is the recursive amplification factor.

Phase Change Energy Storage

Q_storage = m × L_fusion × n_cycles

Where Q_storage is stored thermal energy, m is phase change material mass, L_fusion is latent heat of fusion, and n_cycles is the number of thermal cycles.


---

Recursive Thermal Amplification Mechanics

At each thermal cycle:

Phase change materials store thermal energy during heat absorption phases

Stored thermal energy is released during optimized timing for maximum thermoelectric conversion

A fraction of converted electrical energy powers thermal cycling control systems

The remainder is stored or delivered to the load

Recursive amplification is limited by thermodynamic efficiency limits and thermal losses

The system maintains thermal balance without violating conservation of energy
