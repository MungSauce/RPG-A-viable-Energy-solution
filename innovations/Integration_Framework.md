## Cross-Modal Amplification Mechanisms

### 1. Shared Geometric Optimization
All technologies benefit from vortex and spiral geometries:
- **Electromagnetic vortices** (RPG) can induce **acoustic vortices** (AREH)
- **Thermal circulation** (TGPG) enhances **optical concentration** (PVC)
- **Plasma dynamics** (PFO) couple with **quantum coherence** (QRA)

### 2. Recursive Energy Coupling
Energy harvested by one system can power others:
- RPG electromagnetic energy can drive AREH acoustic resonance
- PVC optical concentration can power TGPG thermal cycling
- All systems contribute to QRA quantum state preparation

### 3. Environmental Adaptation
Multi-modal systems adapt to varying environmental conditions:
- Low light: TGPG + AREH + RPG primary operation
- High acoustic: AREH primary with RPG electromagnetic enhancement
- Optimal solar: PVC + TGPG maximum efficiency mode
